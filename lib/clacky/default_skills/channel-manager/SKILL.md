# Channel Setup Skill

Configure IM platform channels for openclacky.

---

## Command Parsing

| User says | Subcommand |
|---|---|
| `channel setup`, `setup feishu`, `setup wecom`, `setup weixin`, `setup wechat`, `setup discord`, `setup telegram`, `setup dingtalk` | setup |
| `channel status` | status |
| `channel enable feishu/wecom/weixin/discord/telegram/dingtalk` | enable |
| `channel disable feishu/wecom/weixin/discord/telegram/dingtalk` | disable |
| `channel reconfigure` | reconfigure |
| `channel doctor` | doctor |
| `send <message> to weixin/feishu/wecom/discord/telegram/dingtalk` | send |

---

## `status`

Call the server API:

```bash
curl -s http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels
```

Response shape (example):
```json
{"channels":[
  {"platform":"feishu","enabled":true,"running":true,"has_config":true,"app_id":"cli_xxx","domain":"https://open.feishu.cn","allowed_users":[]},
  {"platform":"wecom","enabled":false,"running":false,"has_config":false,"bot_id":""},
  {"platform":"weixin","enabled":true,"running":true,"has_config":true,"has_token":true,"base_url":"https://ilinkai.weixin.qq.com","allowed_users":[]},
  {"platform":"discord","enabled":true,"running":true,"has_config":true,"has_token":true,"allowed_users":[]}
  {"platform":"telegram","enabled":true,"running":true,"has_config":true,"has_token":true,"base_url":"https://api.telegram.org","parse_mode":"Markdown","allowed_users":[]}
]}
```

Display the result:

```
Channel Status
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Platform   Enabled   Running   Details
feishu     ✅ yes    ✅ yes    app_id: cli_xxx...

## `setup`

Ask:
> Which platform would you like to connect?
>
> 1. Feishu
> 2. WeCom (Enterprise WeChat)
> 3. Weixin (Personal WeChat via iLink QR login)
> 4. Discord
> 5. Telegram (Bot API)
> 6. DingTalk

---

### Feishu setup

Use the setup script to create the Feishu app automatically via OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant.
The user only needs to scan a QR code once.

#### Step 1 — Run setup script as a background session

```
terminal(command: "ruby SKILL_DIR/feishu_setup.rb", background: true)
```

Keep polling the session. The script will print:
- `SCAN_URL:<url>` — the QR code URL
- `EXPIRE_IN:<seconds>` — how long the URL is valid

Once you see these lines, tell the user immediately:
- zh: "请在飞书中打开以下链接（或扫码）完成授权，链接 <expire_in> 秒内有效：\n<url>"
- en: "Open this link in Feishu (or scan the QR code) to authorize. Valid for <expire_in>s:\n<url>"

Continue polling until the response contains an `exit_code`. When the session ends successfully, stdout will contain:
- `APP_ID:<app_id>`
- `APP_SECRET:<app_secret>`

Parse both values.

#### Step 2 — Save credentials

```bash
curl -X POST http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/feishu \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"app_id":"<APP_ID>","app_secret":"<APP_SECRET>","domain":"https://open.feishu.cn"}'
```

**CRITICAL: This curl call is the ONLY way to save credentials. NEVER write `~/.clacky/channels.yml`
or any file under `~/.clacky/channels/` directly. The server API handles persistence, hot-reload,
and establishing the long connection.**

On success: tell the user the following (zh), then **continue to Step 3 (Feishu CLI)**:

zh: "✅ 飞书通道已配置成功！现在你可以通过飞书与智能助手进行私聊和群聊，也支持阅读飞书文档。"
en: "✅ Feishu channel configured! You can now chat with the assistant via Feishu DMs or group chats, and read Feishu Docs."

---

#### Step 3 — Optional: install Feishu CLI

Reach here after the channel is configured (Step 2 succeeded). Read `app_id` and `app_secret` from `~/.clacky/channels.yml` (under `channels.feishu`) for the install commands below.

Call `ask_user`:

zh:
```json
{
  \"question\": \"是否安装飞书 CLI？安装后将解锁更多飞书能力，例如创建、编辑、删除云文档。\",
  "options": ["安装", "跳过"]
}
```

en:
```json
{
  "question": "Install Feishu CLI? It unlocks more Feishu capabilities, such as creating, editing, and deleting Docs.",
  "options": ["Install", "Skip"]
}
```

If the user picks Skip, stop — setup is complete.

If the user picks Enable, run the following **in order**:

**Step 3a** — Install and configure (single terminal call):
```bash
lark-cli --version > /dev/null 2>&1 || npm install -g @larksuite/cli
echo -n "<APP_SECRET>" | lark-cli config init --app-id <APP_ID> --app-secret-stdin --brand feishu
ruby "SKILL_DIR/install_feishu_skills.rb"
```

**Step 3b** — Start authorization as a background session:
```
terminal(command: "lark-cli auth login --recommend", background: true)
```

This returns a `session_id`. Keep polling with `terminal(session_id: <id>, input: "")` every few seconds.

Once you see the authorization URL appear in the output, tell the user immediately (do **not** wait for their reply):
- zh: "请在浏览器中打开下方链接完成授权：\n<URL>"
- en: "Open this URL in your browser to authorize:\n<URL>"

Continue polling until the response contains an `exit_code` (meaning the session has ended). **Do not kill the session** — restarting invalidates the device code.

When the session ends with `exit_code: 0`, tell the user:
- zh: "✅ 飞书 CLI 已就绪。"
- en: "✅ Feishu CLI is ready."

**Stop — setup is fully complete.**

---

### WeCom setup

1. Navigate: `open https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/frame#/aiHelper/create`. Pass `isolated: true`. If the browser is not configured (the `open` call fails), just give the user the URL and ask them to open it manually in any browser — the rest of the flow is fully manual and does not need browser automation.
2. If a login page or QR code is shown, tell the user to log in and wait for "done".
3. Guide the user: "Scroll to the bottom of the right panel and click 'API mode creation'. Reply done." Wait for "done".
4. Guide the user: "Click 'Add' next to 'Visible Range'. Select the top-level company node. Click Confirm. Reply done." Wait for "done".
5. Guide the user: "If Secret is not visible, click 'Get Secret'. Copy Bot ID and Secret **before** clicking Save. Paste here. Reply with: Bot ID: xxx, Secret: xxx" Wait for "done".
6. Guide the user: "Click Save. Enter name (e.g. Open Clacky) and description. Click Confirm. Click Save again. Reply done." Wait for "done".
7. Parse credentials. Trim whitespace. Ensure bot_id (starts with `aib`) and secret are not swapped. Run:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/wecom \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"bot_id":"<BOT_ID>","secret":"<SECRET>"}'
   ```

On success: "✅ WeCom channel configured. WeCom client → Contacts → Smart Bot to find it."

---

### Weixin setup (Personal WeChat via iLink QR login)

Weixin uses a QR code login — no app_id/app_secret needed. The token from the QR scan is saved directly in `channels.yml`.

#### Step 1 — Fetch QR code

Run the script in `--fetch-qr` mode to get the QR URL without blocking:

```bash
QR_JSON=$(ruby "SKILL_DIR/weixin_setup.rb" --fetch-qr 2>/dev/null)
echo "$QR_JSON"
```

Parse the JSON output:
- `qrcode_url` — the URL to open in browser (this IS the QR code content)
- `qrcode_id`  — the session ID needed for polling

If the output contains `"error"`, show it and stop.

#### Step 2 — Show QR code to user (browser or manual fallback)

Build the local QR page URL (include current Unix timestamp as `since` to detect new logins only):
```
http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/weixin-qr.html?url=<URL-encoded qrcode_url>&since=<current_unix_timestamp>
```

**Try browser first** — attempt to open the QR page using the browser tool:
```
browser(action="navigate", url="<qr_page_url>")
```

**If browser succeeds:** Tell the user:
> I've opened the WeChat QR code in your browser. Please scan it with WeChat, then confirm in the app.

**If browser fails (not configured or unavailable):** Fall back to manual — tell the user:
> Please open the following link in your browser to scan the WeChat QR code:
>
> `http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/weixin-qr.html?url=<URL-encoded qrcode_url>`
>
> Scan the QR code with WeChat and confirm in the app. I'm already watching for your scan — no need to reply.

**Do NOT wait for the user to reply "done".** Immediately proceed to Step 3 and start polling — exactly as in the browser-succeeds path. The polling script must already be running while the user scans, so it can observe the `scaned → confirmed` transition; otherwise a real scan can be misread as a stale session.

The page renders a proper scannable QR code image. Do NOT open the raw `qrcode_url` directly — that page shows "请使用微信扫码打开" with no actual QR image.

#### Step 3 — Wait for scan and save credentials

As soon as the QR page has been presented to the user — whether you opened it via the browser tool **or** gave the user the manual link — immediately run the polling script in the background. **In both cases, do NOT wait for the user to confirm or reply "done" before starting the poll** — the script must already be running while the user scans:

```bash
ruby "SKILL_DIR/weixin_setup.rb" --qrcode-id "$QRCODE_ID"
```

Where `$QRCODE_ID` is the `qrcode_id` from Step 2's JSON output.

Run this command with `timeout: 60`. If it doesn't succeed, **retry up to 3 times with the same `$QRCODE_ID`** — the QR code stays valid for 5 minutes. Only stop retrying if:
- Exit code is 0 → success
- Output contains "stale-session" → the qrcode_id was already consumed by a prior login; **immediately restart from Step 1** (do NOT retry with same id)
- Output contains "expired" → QR expired, offer to restart from Step 1
- Output contains "timed out" → offer to restart from Step 1
- 3 retries exhausted → show error and offer to restart from Step 1

Tell the user while waiting:
> Waiting for you to scan the QR code and confirm in WeChat... (this may take a moment)

**If exit code is 0:** "✅ Weixin channel configured! You can now message your bot on WeChat."

**If exit code is non-0 or times out:** Show the error and offer to retry from Step 2.

---

### Discord setup

Discord requires manual portal interaction (hCaptcha gates Application creation). The browser just navigates the user to the portal; the user clicks through and pastes the bot token + app id back.

#### Step 1 — Open the developer portal

Get the portal URL from the script and open it in the browser:

```bash
PORTAL_URL=$(ruby "SKILL_DIR/discord_setup.rb" --portal-url)
```

Open it: `browser(action="navigate", url="<PORTAL_URL>")`. If the browser tool is not configured, invoke `browser-setup` first, then retry.

#### Step 2 — Guide the user through the portal (one round-trip)

Tell the user **all** of the following in a single message, then call `ask_user` to collect the values in one reply:

> In the Discord Developer Portal I just opened:
>
> 1. Click **New Application** (top-right). Name it whatever you like (e.g. "Open Clacky"), check the ToS box, click **Create**.
> 2. In the left nav click **Bot**.
> 3. Scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents** and turn on **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**, then click **Save Changes**.
> 4. Scroll up, click **Reset Token** → **Yes, do it!**. Click **Copy** to copy the bot token. (This is the only time the token is shown — don't navigate away before copying.)
> 5. In the left nav click **General Information**. Copy the **Application ID**.
>
> Paste both values back here in this format (one line):
>
> `token=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN app_id=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID`

If the user is chatting in a non-English language, append the localized label in parens after each bolded English button name (e.g. `**Bot**（机器人）`). The English label stays primary — it's what they physically click in the portal.

Use `ask_user` to collect the reply. Parse with tolerant regex (`token=\S+`, `app_id=\d+`).

If the reply is malformed (missing either field), apologise briefly and ask again with the exact same format reminder. Up to 3 retries; after that, surface the original message and stop.

#### Step 3 — Validate, save, invite, wait

1. Validate the token and save credentials:
   ```bash
   ruby "SKILL_DIR/discord_setup.rb" --validate "<BOT_TOKEN>"
   ```
   On success the script prints `{"bot_id":"...","username":"..."}` and the adapter starts.

2. Generate the invite URL using the application id from Step 2:
   ```bash
   ruby "SKILL_DIR/discord_setup.rb" --invite-url "<APP_ID>"
   ```
   Open it: `browser(action="navigate", url="<INVITE_URL>")`. Tell the user:
   > Pick your server from the dropdown → **Continue** → **Authorize**. I'll detect when the bot joins.
   >
   > If the dropdown is empty, you don't have a server yet — open <https://discord.com/channels/@me>, click **Add a Server** (the **+** button on the left sidebar) → **Create My Own** → **For me and my friends** → name it → **Create**, then re-open the invite link.

3. Wait for the bot to join a guild (long-poll, 10 min timeout). Run with `timeout: 620`:
   ```bash
   ruby "SKILL_DIR/discord_setup.rb" --watch-guild
   ```
   On exit 0: "✅ Discord channel configured! Bot is in `<guild_name>`. Mention it or DM it from any channel."
   On timeout: offer to re-open the invite URL — the bot token stays valid.

### Telegram setup (Bot API)

Telegram setup is by far the simplest — no browser automation, no QR. The user creates a bot via @BotFather and pastes the token here.

#### Step 1 — Create a bot via @BotFather

Tell the user:

> Open Telegram and start a chat with **@BotFather** (https://t.me/BotFather). Send `/newbot`, choose a display name and a username ending in `bot`. BotFather will reply with an HTTP API token that looks like `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`. Paste the token here.
>
> Optional: if your network blocks `api.telegram.org`, also tell me the base URL of your self-hosted Bot API server (e.g. `https://my-tg-proxy.example.com`). Otherwise leave it blank.

Wait for the user's reply. Parse the token (matches `^\d+:[\w-]{30,}$`).

#### Step 2 — Save credentials and validate

Call the server API. It calls `getMe` against the Bot API to validate the token before persisting:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/telegram \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bot_token":"<TOKEN>","base_url":"<BASE_URL_OR_OMIT>"}'
```

- `200 { "ok": true }` — token validated and saved. The adapter starts long-polling immediately.
- `422 { "ok": false, "error": "..." }` — show the error (commonly "Unauthorized" → wrong token) and offer to retry.

On success:

> ✅ Telegram channel configured. Open your bot in Telegram and send any message to start chatting.
> 
> **For group chats**: You must disable Privacy Mode in @BotFather first (`/mybots → Bot Settings → Group Privacy → Turn off`), then remove and re-add the bot to the group. Otherwise the bot cannot receive any messages — including @-mentions.

#### Notes

- **Group chats — Privacy Mode (IMPORTANT)**: By default Telegram enables Privacy Mode for all bots, which means the bot **cannot receive any group messages, including @-mentions**. To use the bot in a group you MUST disable Privacy Mode first:
  1. Open @BotFather → `/mybots` → select your bot → `Bot Settings` → `Group Privacy` → **Turn off**
  2. **Remove the bot from the group and re-add it** — the permission change does not apply to groups the bot is already in.
  After that, the bot will respond whenever it is @-mentioned or directly replied to.
- **Self-hosted Bot API**: set `base_url` when `api.telegram.org` is unreachable. See https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api for the official self-hosted server.
- **`allowed_users`**: restrict which Telegram user IDs the bot will respond to. Find a user's numeric ID by messaging @userinfobot.

---

## `enable`

Call the server API to re-enable the platform (this reads from disk, sets enabled, saves, and hot-reloads):

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/<platform> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'
```

If the platform has no credentials (404 or error), redirect to `setup`.

Say: "✅ `<platform>` channel enabled."

---

## `disable`

Call the server API to disable the platform:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/<platform>
```

Say: "❌ `<platform>` channel disabled."

---

### DingTalk setup

#### Step 1 — Get QR code

```bash
ruby "SKILL_DIR/dingtalk_setup.rb" --print-qr
```

Parse the last line starting with `{` to get `qr_url` and `device_code`. On non-0 exit, show the error and abort.

#### Step 2 — Show QR and wait

Show `qr_url` to the user, ask them to scan with the DingTalk mobile app and tap "Create New Robot", then call `ask_user`.

#### Step 3 — Poll for authorization

```bash
ruby "SKILL_DIR/dingtalk_setup.rb" --poll "<device_code>"
```

- **0** → "✅ DingTalk channel configured! Find your robot in DingTalk and send it a message." Stop.
- **2** → not scanned yet. Ask user to confirm, then re-poll. If output contains `WAITING_TIMEOUT` or `expired`, restart from Step 1.
- **1** → show the error and abort.

---

## `reconfigure`

1. Show current config via `GET /api/channels` (mask secrets — show last 4 chars only).
2. Ask: update credentials / change allowed users / add a new platform / enable or disable a platform.
3. For credential updates, re-run the relevant setup flow (which calls `POST /api/channels/<platform>`).
4. **NEVER write `~/.clacky/channels.yml` directly** — always use the server API.
5. Say: "Channel reconfigured."

---

## `doctor`

Check each item, report ✅ / ❌ with remediation:

1. **Config file** — does `~/.clacky/channels.yml` exist and is it readable?
2. **Required keys** — for each enabled platform:
   - Feishu: `app_id`, `app_secret` present and non-empty
   - WeCom: `bot_id`, `secret` present and non-empty
   - Weixin: `token` present and non-empty in `channels.yml`
   - Discord: `bot_token` present and non-empty in `channels.yml`
   - Telegram: `bot_token` present and non-empty
3. **Feishu credentials** (if enabled) — run the token API call, check `code=0`.
4. **Weixin token** (if enabled) — call `GET /api/channels` and check `has_token: true` for the weixin entry.
5. **Telegram credentials** (if enabled) — call `getMe` against the Bot API:
   ```bash
   BOT_TOKEN=$(ruby -ryaml -e 'puts (YAML.load_file(File.expand_path("~/.clacky/channels.yml"))["channels"]["telegram"]["bot_token"] rescue "")')
   BASE_URL=$(ruby -ryaml -e 'puts (YAML.load_file(File.expand_path("~/.clacky/channels.yml"))["channels"]["telegram"]["base_url"] || "https://api.telegram.org" rescue "https://api.telegram.org")')
   curl -s "$BASE_URL/bot$BOT_TOKEN/getMe" | grep -q '"ok":true' && echo "✅ Telegram OK" || echo "❌ Telegram credentials rejected by getMe"
   ```
6. **WeCom credentials** (if enabled) — search today's log:
   ```bash
   grep -iE "wecom adapter loop started|WeCom authentication failed|WeCom WS error response|WecomAdapter" \
     ~/.clacky/logger/clacky-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
   ```
   - `WeCom authentication failed` or non-zero errcode → ❌ "WeCom credentials incorrect"
   - `adapter loop started` with no auth error → ✅
6. **Discord credentials** (if enabled) — call `GET /api/channels` and check `has_token: true`. Search today's log:
   ```bash
   grep -iE "DiscordAdapter|discord-gateway|/users/@me failed" \
     ~/.clacky/logger/clacky-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
   ```
   - `/users/@me failed` → ❌ "Discord token invalid or revoked — re-run setup"
   - `authenticated as` with no error → ✅
7. **DingTalk credentials** (if enabled) — search today's log:
   ```bash
   grep -iE "dingtalk-ws|DingTalk.*error|stream.*error" \
     ~/.clacky/logger/clacky-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
   ```
   - `WebSocket connected` → ✅
   - `Stream endpoint error` or `token error` → ❌ "DingTalk credentials invalid — re-run setup"

---

## `send`

Proactively send a message to a user via an IM channel adapter.

### Parse the request

Extract two things from the user's instruction:
- **platform** — one of `weixin`, `feishu`, `wecom`, `discord`, `telegram`, `dingtalk`
- **message** — the text content to send

If the platform cannot be inferred, ask the user to clarify.

### Step 1 — Resolve target user (optional)

If the user specified a `user_id`, use it directly.

Otherwise, list known users first:

```bash
curl -s http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/<platform>/users
```

- If the list is **empty**: tell the user "No known users for `<platform>`. The target user must send at least one message to the bot before proactive messaging is possible." Stop here.
- If there is **exactly one** user: use it silently.
- If there are **multiple** users: show the list and ask which one to send to, unless the user already specified one.

### Step 2 — Send the message

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://${CLACKY_SERVER_HOST}:${CLACKY_SERVER_PORT}/api/channels/<platform>/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "<message>", "user_id": "<user_id>"}'
```

**Response handling:**

| HTTP status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `200 { ok: true }` | Delivered | Tell user: "✅ Message sent to `<platform>`." |
| `400` platform not running | Adapter is stopped | Tell user the platform is not running and suggest `channel enable <platform>`. |
| `400` no context_token | Token missing | Explain: "The bot has no active session token for this user. Ask the user to send any message to the bot first, then retry." |
| `503` no known users | Nobody has messaged the bot | Same guidance as empty user list above. |
| Other error | Unexpected | Show the error message from the response body. |

### Constraints & notes

- **Weixin (iLink protocol)**: Every outbound message requires a `context_token` that is obtained from the most recent inbound message from that user. The token is cached in memory and reset on server restart. If the server was restarted since the user last wrote, the token is gone and the send will fail — the user must message the bot again.
- **Feishu / WeCom / Discord / Telegram**: No per-message token required. As long as the adapter is running and the `user_id` / `chat_id` (or Discord channel/user id) is valid, the message will be delivered. For Telegram specifically, the `user_id` must be a Telegram chat_id that the bot can write to — the user must have sent at least one message to the bot first.
- This feature is intended for **proactive notifications** (e.g. task completion, reminders). It is not a replacement for the normal reply flow triggered by inbound messages.

---

## Security

- Always mask secrets in output (last 4 chars only).
- Config file must be `chmod 600`.
